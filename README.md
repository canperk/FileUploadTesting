# FileUploadTesting

This junior repository was created for testing crowded file input forms. Somehow we wanted to skip this time consumer issue. When we need to test pages which are included many input file controls, it was feeling us a nightmare because of selecting files manually. 

This practise is only for development usage for quick page tests
